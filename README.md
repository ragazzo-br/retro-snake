## 🕹️ About

Welcome to the most pixelated, nostalgic journey back to the 60s/70s era of gaming! This ain't your fancy 3D, ultra-realistic, battery-draining mobile game. Nope, this is **RETRO SNAKE** - where every pixel matters and your only mission is to eat apples without eating yourself (deep, right?).

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys (↑, ↓, ←, →) to navigate your digital serpent
2. Eat the red apples to grow longer and score points
3. Avoid colliding with yourself (it's harder than it sounds)
4. Compete for the high score (against yourself, your cat, or whoever's watching)
5. Feel the tension build as your snake grows longer!

## 🚀 Features

- Authentic retro-style graphics that would make Atari proud
- Mind-blowing 8-bit sound effects (sort of)
- Groundbreaking "pass-through-walls" technology
- Detailed apple graphics (we even added a stem and leaf!)
- No in-app purchases, no ads, no nonsense

## 💻 Installation

```bash
# Clone this masterpiece of digital art
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/retro-snake.git

# Navigate to the game directory
cd retro-snake

# No need to build anything! Just open index.html in your browser
# Like it's 1975!
```

## 📱 Mobile Support

Are you serious? This is a RETRO game! But fine, it should work on mobile too. Tap the screen corners to change direction (it's not the same though).

## 🧠 Technical Details

This game is built with:
- HTML5 Canvas (because we're modern retro)
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks were harmed in the making of this game)
- CSS3 (for those sweet, sweet glowing effects)
- Love for simplicity

- ## 🔄 Alternative Version

**Second alternative:** If something crazy happens and the game doesn't run with the multi-file setup, try this second alternative - the full game is in a single file!

```
snake-game-all-in-one.html
```

This file contains everything (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) in one neat package. Just download it and open it in any browser. No web server, no dependencies, no nonsense - just pure retro gaming goodness!

How to use it:
1. Download the `snake-game-all-in-one.html` file
2. Double-click it to open in your browser
3. Start playing immediately!

Perfect for when you're trapped in a time machine back in 1975 and need a quick game fix. Or, you know, when you just want something that works with no fuss. 🕹️
